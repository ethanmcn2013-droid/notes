/**
 * In-memory demo dataset for Signal Notes.
 *
 * Used only when access-mode is demo/review (see lib/access-mode.ts). The
 * real Turso DB is never touched in that mode, so this is the *entire* world
 * a reviewer sees. It must feel like a real, lived-in notebook — calm
 * coordination for normal people — not a lorem-ipsum placeholder.
 *
 * The cast of one person: a wedding-venue duty manager who also helps run a
 * small studio and is finishing a night course. Notes are written the way
 * people actually capture in three seconds: fragments, half-thoughts, the odd
 * extract pulled out toward Tasks.
 *
 * No real person's data appears here. Timestamps are computed relative to
 * "now" at read time so the notebook always looks freshly used.
